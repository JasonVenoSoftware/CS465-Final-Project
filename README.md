# CS465-Final-Project

# Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
In this project, I mostly worked with Express and SPA.  The key difference here is how Express utilizes the Node.js framework to provide features for the application.  This is effective, and in some ways faster than SPA, but puts a lot of unnecessary stress on the system, which is where SPA proves its true value.  

# Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
Following with our use of the MEAN Stack, MongoDB uses JavaScript, which makes it much easier to connect everything.  This is because JavaScript is used for working with the frontend AND the backend, whish allowed for a much smoother transition.  

# How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
JSON uses key-value pairs, which can be read, edited, and used by JavaScript.  This makes searching for specific data simplistic and efficient.  

# Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
Many iterations of this project increased efficiency overtime.  For example, the rough draft of this project utilized just static HTML, which underwent numerous changes before finally utilizing JSON, JavaScript, SPA, etc.  

# How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
Throughout my degree I worked on each of these things separately.  I've worked with both SQL and MongoDB databases (Data Analytics Minor), frontend development (UI/UX Development), backend development (Client/Server Development), and much more.  Putting all of this together helped me to become more marketable in my original career plan of Software Engineering, but will also help me with my current career interest of Data Science (which regularly involves me engineering software anyways).
